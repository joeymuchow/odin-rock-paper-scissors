# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is a project from The Odin Project's Foundations course. We are creating a rock paper scissors game that is played in the console.

I decided to leave the pseudocode I wrote above each function. For evaluating the results of a round I feel like the large if else statement is potentially not the best way to do it, but it is what I could think of for now.
